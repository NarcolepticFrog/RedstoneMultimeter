# Redstone Multimeter Mod

This is a minecraft 1.12.2 mod that lets you record when blocks are powered with gametick accuracy.
The idea is that it can be a useful debugging and design tool for redstone contraptions.
The mod lets you place virtual "meters" in the world which record the power level of a block for the last 60 game ticks.
This information is displayed using a simple GUI and can be paused for careful inspection.

Here's a short video explaining the mod and showing some examples of how to use it: https://youtu.be/RdrHvInW0O4.
